The phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) starts by performing an eigendecomposition of a pairwise double-centered phylogenetic distance matrix between species. The eigenvectors estimated values express phylogenetic trends in data and residuals express independent evolution of each species using lambda mthod.
